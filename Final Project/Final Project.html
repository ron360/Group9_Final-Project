                    <b>Identify credit card fraud</b>
                    <br>
                    Abnormal detection can be applied to identify credit card fraud, helping financial institutions 
                    recognize irregular credit card transactions to safeguard customers' financial security. 
                    Supervised learning can be utilized to learn patterns of fraud and normal transactions from vast 
                    amounts of transaction data. Models can be trained based on known fraud cases. 
                    <p>Alternatively, unsupervised learning methods can be employed to automatically discover abnormal patterns. Additionally, statistical methods such as mean, 
                    standard deviation, percentiles, ..., can be used to analyze users' historical transaction data. Transactions deviating significantly 
                    from the normal pattern can be flagged as abnormal. By leveraging these methods, financial institutions can build robust abnormal detection systems, 
                    enhancing the ability to detect credit card fraud while minimizing false positives and ensuring legitimate transactions are unaffected.</p>
                </li>

                    <b>Industrial production</b>
                    <br>
                    Abnormal detection in the industrial production domain relies on advanced algorithms that leverage real-time data monitoring and analysis. 
                    These algorithms typically employ unsupervised learning, eliminating the need for specific defect data, 
                    and instead undergo pre-training using normal operational data. 
                    <p> By comparing real-time production data, the algorithms can identify abnormal patterns or values, indicating potential issues. This technology contributes 
                    to improving production line efficiency, optimizing quality, and simultaneously reducing failure rates. </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, it facilitates the implementation of predictive maintenance, allowing businesses to proactively prevent machine failures and minimize downtime. In summary, abnormal detection provides powerful tools for industrial production, 
                    enabling the realization of a more reliable, efficient, and sustainable manufacturing environment.</p>

                    <b>Assistance in account security</b>
                    <br>
                    The application of anomaly detection in account security can provide significant assistance in reducing some cybersecurity risks. 
                    By collecting user behaviors and authentication activities, such as login times, IP addresses, used devices, and performed operations, 
                    it is possible to establish a model of normal user behavior. 
                    <p>Subsequently, this model can be applied to real-time data to detect abnormal behaviors.
                    The use of anomaly detection can help prevent abnormal activities, such as hacking attempts, by detecting issues before they cause actual harm, 
                    thereby proactively identifying potential security risks. The model can also be updated based on new data and behavior patterns to adapt to changes in system and user behavior.</p>
